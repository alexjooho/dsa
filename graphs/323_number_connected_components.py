# neetcode solution 2 using a class for union find and hashmap instead of array:
# this solution basically doesn't use the ranking but uses path compression
# this saves space but uses up more time when doing find
# instead of subtracting 1 from total unions each time a union is made/added to, it simply
# makes a set of all the parents (since duplicate parents can't be added to set) and checks the length of it
# this works because it calls find parent on every single node again to make sure it is fully updated
# otherwise, some nodes might not have parents that are fully updated to the root parent and instead
# just the parent above it
# NOTE: this solution isn't as time efficient and is probably harder to come up with in an interview
